# CLAUDE.md

Conventions for any agent working on `claude-agent-harness-optimization`. Read this first.

## What this is

This repo is a public, standalone prompt kit for Claude-style agents. It renders agent system
prompts from recipes, scores whether a task deserves an agent, lints tool descriptions, runs
deterministic evals over agent transcripts and final state, and uses a live Claude judge for
semantic trace audits. It also runs model matrix sweeps to tune tool descriptions, provider
harnesses, `CLAUDE.md` style instructions, and skills across model generations.

## Run it

    pip install -e .
    python -m claude_agent_prompting render recipes/agentic_search.json
    python -m claude_agent_prompting score recipes/agentic_search.json
    python -m claude_agent_prompting eval evals/examples/search_answer.json
    python -m claude_agent_prompting model-matrix evals/model_matrix/coding_tool_selection.json

## Rules

- Keep it standalone. Do not reference parent workspaces, private notes, or local-only files.
- Keep it generic. Do not add interview framing, employer-specific context, or individual names.
- Track reasoning and tool use explicitly. Real audits must include visible reasoning summaries or
  decision notes, ordered tool calls, tool outputs, and final answers.
- Enforce directed thinking in traces and prompts. Before the first tool, visible reasoning must
  mention complexity, tool budget, and evidence or stop criteria. After tool results, visible
  reasoning must mention quality, verification, and the continue or stop decision.
- Apply the value bar everywhere. An audit, prompt change, tool change, or eval change passes only
  when it is adversarially-confirmed to add value: it must name the value claim, compare against a
  baseline, meet a minimum improvement threshold, and survive an adversarial check with no open
  objections.
- Source Claude and agent-prompting claims. If a factual claim changes, update
  `docs/source-map.md` with the public source used.
- Deterministic tests stay runnable without an API key. CI and real audits require the live Claude
  judge through `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Cross-provider matrix sweeps use `.env` keys when supplied.
- Secrets never get committed. `.env` stays git-ignored.
- Prose is deslop-clean: no em-dashes, no en-dashes, no semicolons, and no buzzwords. Run
  `python scripts/deslop_check.py` before shipping.
