# Confirmed Improvements

This ledger separates confirmed tuning wins from passing guardrails. A tool catalog can pass now and
still count as an improvement when the tuned variant beat a weaker baseline under the same eval.

Checked through 2026-06-28.

## Promotion Bar

A change is promoted only when it clears the repo bar:

- same task, same provider or harness cell, baseline versus candidate
- live model call, not only static review
- realistic prompt with a verifiable outcome
- no verifier trick, brittle exact-match dependency, or held-out regression
- value maps to a practical failure avoided before execution

## Cross-Target Lessons

What is working:

- Most mature public MCP catalogs passed the current slices outright. GitHub, Playwright, Slack,
  Filesystem, Postgres MCP Pro, Context7, and ClickHouse are useful guardrails, not current
  description rewrites.
- gstack also looks strong. The historical full run passed 708 of 720 live cells with zero errors.
- The useful feedback is narrow. The wins came from adjacent-boundary confusion, not broad tool
  catalog failure.

What produced confirmed value:

- Firecrawl needed a sharper scrape-versus-extract boundary for one known URL with structured
  fields.
- Supabase needed schema-changing SQL to route to migrations, not ordinary SQL execution.
- Zymtrace needed resource-first/default-project rules, metrics-first GPU workflows, and bounded
  hot-trace drilldown arguments.
- Screenpipe needed exact keyword lookup to route to `keyword-search`, not broader content search.
- InsForge needed relative deployment paths to stop before `create-deployment`.
- gstack needed browser-alias and safety-mode routing tightened. The historical 720-cell run is
  compatibility evidence, and later high-profile smoke checks covered sensitive cases. A stronger
  upstream-facing claim should rerun the full matrix on current frontier/latest profiles before those
  results are used as the headline.

How usefulness is proven:

- Each promoted suggestion compares baseline and candidate descriptions on the same realistic
  prompts, providers, harnesses, and instruction variants.
- The useful signal is a live model-call delta that changes the next tool call or required
  arguments in the ambiguous boundary case.
- Upstream-facing claims should be led by current frontier/latest model and harness results.
  Historical, high, balanced, or older-model cells are still useful regression coverage, but they
  should be labeled that way.
- The packet includes source pins, exact cases, reproduction commands, and result artifacts so an
  upstream maintainer can rerun or challenge the claim.

Downside of ignoring confirmed suggestions:

- Plausible adjacent tools keep winning, which makes bad routing hard to notice in transcripts.
- Model and harness upgrades can reintroduce the same mistake unless the boundary is encoded as a
  regression case.
- Wrong tool choice can increase cost, choose a broader workflow than requested, skip migration
  safety, or apply safety constraints the user did not ask for.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Firecrawl MCP | `firecrawl-mcp` 3.22.0, `firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server` commit `e744bba494c0e77086d66af838d7a64fab52f138` | `legacy_firecrawl_mcp` | `tuned_firecrawl_mcp_boundaries` | Anthropic full run moved from 11/12 to 12/12. The adversarial single-page structured-fields case failed on legacy and passed on tuned across Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, native tools, and prompt JSON. | [Firecrawl packet](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/evals/pr_packets/firecrawl_mcp_tool_tuning_2026-06-25): for one exact URL plus specific fields, use `firecrawl_scrape` with JSON format. Reserve `firecrawl_extract` for multi-page or broader extraction jobs. |
| Supabase MCP database tools | `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase` 0.8.2, `supabase/mcp` commit `100565f26d7eec6d314a08597ded22da63045923` | `terse_supabase_database_mcp` | `tuned_supabase_database_boundaries` | Anthropic full run moved from 6/9 to 9/9. Cross-provider DDL/RLS cells moved failing native and prompt-JSON cells to 3/3, with no regression in the OpenAI prompt-JSON cell that already passed. | [Supabase packet](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/evals/pr_packets/supabase_mcp_database_tool_tuning_2026-06-25): route schema-changing SQL to `apply_migration`. Use `execute_sql` only for regular non-schema SQL. |
| Zymtrace MCP | `zymtrace-mcp` 26.6.1 endpoint inspection, Zymtrace skills plugin 26.6.0, and local GPU-enabled profiler verification on 2026-06-30 | `stock_zymtrace_mcp` + `zymtrace_host_and_skill_rules` | `tuned_zymtrace_mcp_boundaries` + `zymtrace_host_and_skill_rules` | Expanded held-out prompt-JSON run moved from 4/8 to 8/8 on Anthropic, 5/8 to 8/8 on OpenAI, and 5/8 to 8/8 on Gemini. Stock missed default project UUIDs, metric-discovery arguments, bounded full-trace drilldown arguments, and one resource fallback. Tuned passed all held-out tool/skill boundary cases. | [Zymtrace packet](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/evals/pr_packets/zymtrace_mcp_tool_tuning_2026-06-30): prefer resource-first fallbacks, default project `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`, metrics-first GPU/inference workflows, rank-first CPU workflows, and bounded `hot_traces` drilldown with `prefix_hash`, `meta_only=false`, and `limit=1`. |
| Screenpipe MCP | `screenpipe-mcp` 0.18.14, `screenpipe/screenpipe` commit `2de07ff501a63d3d3f0f39a9a602640a833d151f` | `readme_screenpipe_mcp` | `source_tuned_screenpipe_mcp` | Anthropic prompt-JSON run moved from 6/7 to 7/7. README-level descriptions routed exact keyword lookup to `search-content`. Source-level tuned descriptions routed it to `keyword-search`. | [Screenpipe packet](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/evals/pr_packets/screenpipe_mcp_tool_tuning_2026-06-28): route literal keyword or exact phrase lookup to `keyword-search`. Reserve `search-content` for broader content search. |
| InsForge MCP | `@insforge/mcp` 1.2.10, `InsForge/insforge-mcp` commit `dad794d445d05e7df2efcb8280dba59682b97a87` | `readme_insforge_mcp` | `source_tuned_insforge_mcp` | Anthropic prompt-JSON run moved from 15/16 to 16/16. README-level descriptions routed a relative source-directory deployment request to `create-deployment`. Source-level tuned descriptions routed it to `NO_TOOL`. | [InsForge packet](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/evals/pr_packets/insforge_mcp_tool_tuning_2026-06-28): require an absolute `sourceDirectory` before calling `create-deployment`. Reject relative deploy paths before tool call. |

## Guardrails Without Promotion

| Target | Upstream Pin | Result | Why Not Promoted |
|---|---|---|---|
| ClickHouse MCP | `mcp-clickhouse` 0.4.0, `clickhouse/mcp-clickhouse` commit `ccef141dbd4e482111c8b8803962339b1f3bf1d7` | Stock and tuned both passed 42/42 across Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini prompt-JSON cells. Mutation prompts correctly returned `NO_TOOL` for the read-only visible catalog. | No baseline delta. Keep the matrix as a safety and regression guardrail. |
| Context7 MCP | `@upstash/context7` 1.0.0, `upstash/context7` commit `a914a8693488f1a7b37581de176ad1f19def8e64` | README-style and tuned descriptions both passed the tested library-resolution boundary. | No baseline delta. |
| GitHub MCP Server | `github/github-mcp-server` commit `9430064a2becb382644042ce9fe5752ace1d8409` | Stock and tuned variants both passed the tested repository, issue, pull request, and Actions cases. | No baseline delta. |
| Playwright MCP | `microsoft/playwright-mcp` commit `511320db60d6774557243a32b2ff201f14ca4188` | Stock and tuned variants both passed after an unfair verifier was corrected. | The apparent miss was verifier quality, not tool wording. |
| Postgres MCP Pro | `crystaldba/postgres-mcp` public docs and repo reference checked from the matrix source | Stock and tuned variants both passed the tested schema, SQL, explain, workload, index, and health cases. | No baseline delta. |
| Slack MCP | Slack official MCP docs and Docker MCP reference checked from the matrix source | Stock and tuned variants both passed the tested channel, thread, message, reaction, and user cases. | No baseline delta. |
| Filesystem MCP | Model Context Protocol filesystem registry and Docker MCP reference checked from the matrix source | Stock and tuned variants both passed after an isolated rerun. | The apparent miss was transient, not a stable description gap. |
| Humwork MCP | `humwork-mcp` 1.1.1, `humworkai/humwork-mcp` commit `278bc96500d6b04a780fcf5ca04d190ab6adb85b` | README-level and skill-tuned variants both passed 7/7 on Anthropic prompt JSON. | No baseline delta. Keep the [Humwork guardrail packet](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/evals/pr_packets/humwork_mcp_guardrail_2026-06-28) as retained evidence. |
| OpenWork UI MCP | `openwork-ui-mcp` 0.1.0, `different-ai/openwork` commit `3c06ab620f8f867b0cf08e88617131bcfe24fa53` | Docs-level and source-tuned variants both passed 7/7 on Anthropic prompt JSON. | No baseline delta. Keep the [OpenWork guardrail packet](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/evals/pr_packets/openwork_ui_mcp_guardrail_2026-06-28) as retained evidence. |

## How The Signals Were Found

The repo uses matrix files under `evals/model_matrix/`. Each matrix defines:

- provider profiles
- harnesses such as native tools or prompt JSON
- baseline and candidate tool-description variants
- realistic cases with expected tools and confusable alternatives
- optional argument checks that avoid overfitting valid alternatives

The useful signal is a live baseline-to-candidate delta. Firecrawl, Supabase, Zymtrace, and
Screenpipe and InsForge changed the next tool call or required arguments in exactly the ambiguous
boundary case. ClickHouse, Context7, GitHub, Playwright, Postgres, Slack, Filesystem, Humwork, and
OpenWork did not show that delta, so their matrices stay as regression coverage.

## Skill Pin

The project-local agent audit skill lives at `.claude/skills/agent-audit/SKILL.md`. It is versioned
with this repository rather than an external package. The skill-selection matrix is
`evals/model_matrix/agent_audit_skill_selection.json`, and the current public pin before this ledger
was repo commit `f307a8684222e88420b6dc538d77d311af388d02`.
